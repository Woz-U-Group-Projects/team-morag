Amora

We propose to create a Dating friend social site. Named Amora. 
Amora is a site where terrestrials - earth inhabitants can come together, share pictures, ideas, meet with one another and join in the activities. 



We will be using angular as the front end and .net Entity framework as the backend. We will also be using SQL lite for the database. And cloud Ordinary for the picture uploads.


The user will be able to register and pick a username. Once registered the user/member can log in to a member area where the user can search and view other members. The members can give each other likes. 

 In the user's profile area, the user can see who has liked them and who they have liked on a listing page. Members can upload and post pictures and send messages to one another. There will be also different pages to navigate to that have games and activities. The user can create their profile and edit their profile information. Their profile will be available for other members to see. 


Our stretch goal is to have Amora up and running in the cloud.
