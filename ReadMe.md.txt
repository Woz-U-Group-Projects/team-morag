Amora is a site where terrestrials - earth inhabitants can come together, share pictures, ideas, meet with one another and join in the activities. 

Initial features shall include Branding, Simplicity, Reliability, Consistency and a Seamless UI.

•	Once registered the user/member can log in to a member area where the user can search and view other members.
•	As a member of Amora I would like to be able to like other members 
•	In the user's profile area, the user can see who has liked them and who they have liked on a listing page.
•	Members can upload and post pictures and send messages to one another.
•	There will be also different pages to navigate to that have games and activities.
•	The user can create their profile and edit their profile information.

We will meet the minimum project requirements by using angular as the front end and .NET Entity framework as the backend. We will also be using SQL lite for the database, and GitHub for source control. This application will also be Responsive to enable broad device compatibility. And Cloudinary for the picture uploads.

 Our stretch goal is to have Amora up and running in the cloud.
